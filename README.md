hands-on workshop for research data management and good research practice

developed by @arockenberger, based on the article ["Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing" by Greg Wilson, Jennifer Bryan, Karen Cranston, Justin Kitzes, Lex Nederbragt, Tracy K. Teal (2017)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) together with @uio-carpentry study group.

Feel free to contribute by filing issues (questions, comments, ideas) or suggesting edits (fork and create a pull-request) or joing the life sessions (Sep 5 and Sep 19, 4-6pm) in the [study group](https://uio-carpentry.github.io/studyGroup/#portfolio)

Tentative goal: Test-run hands-on workshop in early 2020 as supplement to Research Data Management workshops at University of Oslo.
