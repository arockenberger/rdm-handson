# Collection of ideas

## Scope

- develop short hands-on workshop based on the article "Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing" by Wilson et al. 2017
- workshop could be conceptualized as a supplementary hands-on part to the research data management workshops at UiO
- could serve generally as guide to good practice (if instructions are brief and executable)


## Excerpts from the article

### Introduction

*ALWAYS add page numbers for both paraphrases and direct quotes from the article!*
- target audience of article - and of workshop - is researchers from any field who are novices in programming and data wrangling: people who are using a computer mostly every day for work, study, leisure, but who do not do any programming and mainly use proprietary office software, applications that run in a browser and perhaps domain specific software and applications
- additionally: researchers who work alone or with a few collaborators on projects lasting a few days to several months (this is very often the case for graduate students; it is also widely the modes operandi in the Humanities)
- goal: which are the first accessible skills and perspectives any such learner needs to develop? (p.2)
- "minimum set of tools and techniques [â€¦] every researcher can and should consider adopting" (p.2)

**Main Topics**

1. Data management
2. Code (Software / Programming)
3. Collaboration
4. Project Organisation
5. Tracking changes
6. Writing manuscripts

- could be used to structure the workshop into units / episodes

### Data Management

#### STEP 1
- make copy of raw data
- enable read-only access to raw data file
- alternatively: record exact procedure used to obtain raw data + other pertinent info (version nr., date of download etc.)

#### STEP 2
- ensure reliable back-up is in place (check with local IT)

#### STEP 3
- create usable data, in open formats (think .csv instead of .xlsx for tables; think .xml, .json, .yaml for non-tabular data (trees, graphs), etc.)
  - find some good examples from different fields of research here!
- usable means for both humans and machines
- variable names should be human-readable ("tidy data")
- clear, human and machine readable filenames without whitespace

#### STEP 4
- create analysis-friendly data
  - each column is a variable
  - each row is an observation

#### STEP 5
- record all steps used to process data
